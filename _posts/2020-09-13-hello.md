<!-- Following the tradition of developers' blogging, this post has been named
**Hello World** - to indicate that this post is where my blog started from.
Through this post, I'd also like to explain about how this blog has been
built. -->

I've seen quite a lot of developers' blogs starting with a **Hello World** post, so
continuing the tradition, I would like to explain how I made this blog and how it is
a bit different in the choice of UI Frameworks from the rest.

### **Front-end**

I used [React](https://reactjs.org/) along with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) as the frameworks for the home-page. I used [Fluent UI](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fluentui#/), a UX framework developed and maintained by **Microsoft** to design the components.
Fluent UI provides a large number of reusable controls and styles which can be used as normal React Components.

No one likes a slow website or a website which is not Accessible. I found a tool called [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse), which helped me optimize a lot of things here and there. After fixing a lot of issues, I managed to get a good score on all the areas.
A detailed report can be found [here](/assets/report.html). Finally, I spent a lot of time to make the website **Mobile Responsive** by carefully using the flex elements and viewports.

**Reasons for this unconventional Framework choice?** My internship project used a lot of TypeScript and Fluent UI, and, so it was a natural choice for me to try out something fun using these frameworks.

### **Blog**

For implementing the blog functionality, I used the powerful static site generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). I modified the default `minima` theme to use the great post structure it has along with my designs achieving the Best of Both worlds. The blog-posts are `Markdown` files, which are converted to html pages by the almighty Jekyll.

The blog works as of now, but has a lot of scope for improvement, a few of which I can currently see are

-- Todos --

* Add tags to posts
* Add functionality to respond to posts
* Improve the UI of Blog's homepage
* Make the content more engaging

### **Conclusion**

The code for the blog and homepage can be found [here](https://github.com/07kshitij/07kshitij.github.io). Look forward to some insightful suggestions on making it even better.
